You are an intelligent AI coding assistant working on the "Price Simulation" project.

# CRITICAL WORKSPACE RULES

**1. ALWAYS INITIALIZE CONTEXT**
Before starting any complex task (planning, refactoring, debugging logic, or major feature work), you **MUST** read the file `AI_CONTEXT.md` in the root directory.

**2. SOURCE OF TRUTH**
- `AI_CONTEXT.md` contains the "Game Rules" (Locked files, Business Logic, Synchronization rules).
- `src/lib/constants.ts` contains the shared values (Market data, Contract terms, Margins).

**3. "BOT" SYNCHRONIZATION**
- The "Bots" (Telegram Shop, Price List Generator, Simulator) must work in tandem.
- NEVER hardcode business values (e.g., Electricity Rate $0.06, Profit Margin 50%) in components.
- ALWAYS import them from `src/lib/constants.ts`.

**4. LOCKED FILES**
- Do not modify `src/lib/price-simulator-calculator.ts` or `src/lib/treasury-calculator.ts` without explicit user permission and running tests.

**5. RUN TESTS BEFORE DEPLOYMENT**
- You **MUST** run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass before suggesting a deployment or committing changes that affect business logic or UI components.
